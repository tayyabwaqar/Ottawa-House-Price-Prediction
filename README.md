# Real Estate Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between various numerical features of real estate properties and their prices. The dataset includes information such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage spaces, and property prices. The goal is to visualize these relationships to understand how different features influence property prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejusrevi/ottawa-real-estate-data/data). It contains the following columns:

- **postalCode**: The postal code of the property.
- **propertyType**: The type of property (e.g., Lots/Acreage, Commercial).
- **style**: The style of the property (e.g., Lot, Commercial).
- **bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the property.
- **bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the property.
- **garage**: The number of garage spaces.
- **price**: The price of the property.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. 

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine
Load the dataset and run the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Visualize the relationships between numerical variables and property prices using histograms. The following plots are generated:
Bedrooms vs. Price
Bathrooms vs. Price
Garage vs. Price

# Visualization Example
The following visualizations illustrate the relationships between property prices and various numerical features:
Bedrooms with Price: This histogram shows how the number of bedrooms correlates with property prices.
Bathrooms with Price: This histogram displays the relationship between the number of bathrooms and property prices.
Garage with Price: This histogram illustrates how the presence of garage spaces affects property prices.

# Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into how different features of real estate properties impact their prices. Understanding these relationships can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.
